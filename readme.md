## About
EtherHammerX is a client-side anti-cheat framework for the game Project Zomboid. The framework aims to:
- Provide "out-of-the-box" anti-cheat protection against cheats like **EtherHack**.
- Fight anti-cheat tampering & bypassing.
- Provide servers with customizable and configurable anti-cheat keys & modules.

## Installation
EtherHammerX requires the following workshop items to work:
- [asledgehammer_utilities](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3360195806) (Workshop ID: 3360195806)
- [modloader](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3367051185) (Workshop ID: 3367051185)
- [etherhammerx](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3367055125) (Workshop ID: 3367055125)

> **NOTE**: These utilities are separate workshop mods so modders can use them for other projects.

## Customization & Development
EtherHammerX is built around open-source security and customization. Customization and additional modules allows servers to take security into their own hands. Refer to the Wiki in this repository for help on customization and development of anti-cheat modules for your server.
